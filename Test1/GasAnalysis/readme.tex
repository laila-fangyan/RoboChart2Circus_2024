GasAnalysis.rct is from the RoboChart project "ChemicalDetector-autonomous8_GA_modified"
this vesion is modified from the 8 version from the RoboStar website: making Reading as the first state after initial instead of NoGas.
Z-Machine paper also use this version of stm.
In Test1, GasAnalysis.rct combines GasAnalysis.rct and chemical.rct in project "ChemicalDetector-autonomous8_GA_modified".
In project "ChemicalDetector-autonomous8_GA_modified", GasAnalysis.rct has run FDR ddlf test and passed. This test can be used 
to compare with Isabelle verification results (also the time load).
